                            Bhagat Singh, an iconic figure in the history of India's struggle for independence, was born on September 28, 1907, in Banga, Punjab, under British rule. A fervent nationalist, revolutionary, and martyr, Bhagat Singh left an indelible mark on the collective consciousness of the Indian people.
                            
                            Growing up in an environment charged with anti-colonial sentiments, Bhagat Singh witnessed the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919, a tragic event that deeply affected him. The brutality of the British Raj fueled his determination to fight against injustice and oppression. Bhagat Singh's journey into revolutionary activities began early, influenced by the sacrifices of freedom fighters and the need for radical change.
                            
                            One of the defining moments in Bhagat Singh's life was the unjust execution of Lala Lajpat Rai in the aftermath of a peaceful protest against the Simon Commission. Seeking retribution, Bhagat Singh and his comrades planned and executed the daring act of avenging Lala Lajpat Rai's death. However, the plan went awry, and instead of the intended target, police officer James A. Scott was mistakenly killed.
                            
                            Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev, recognizing the gravity of their actions, courted arrest and used the trial as a platform to propagate their vision of a free and independent India. The trio faced the gallows on March 23, 1931, in Lahore Central Jail, displaying unparalleled courage and fortitude. Their sacrifice not only intensified the struggle against British rule but also inspired a new generation of freedom fighters.
                            
                            What set Bhagat Singh apart was not only his commitment to the cause of independence but also his intellectual acumen. He was well-versed in revolutionary literature and used his writings to articulate his vision for a just and egalitarian society. His famous slogan "Inquilab Zindabad" became the rallying cry for those fighting against colonial subjugation.
                            
                            Bhagat Singh's legacy extends beyond his role as a revolutionary. He was a symbol of defiance against tyranny, a voice for the voiceless, and an embodiment of selfless sacrifice. The memory of Bhagat Singh continues to resonate in the hearts of millions, reminding them of the price paid for freedom.
                            
                            Bhagat Singh’s Revolutionary Activities/Contributions to Freedom Struggle
                            Although there have been many leaders from the revolutionary mould, Bhagat Singh’s name is always first quoted when talking about revolutionary freedom fighters of India.

                            In 1926, he founded the Naujawan Bharat Sabha.
                            This organisation aimed to encourage revolution against British rule by rallying the peasants and workers.
                            Singh served as the organisation’s secretary.
                            In 1928, he established the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) along with Sukhdev, Chandrashekhar Azad and others.
                            Lala Lajpat Rai died in 1928 as a result of injuries sustained in a police lathi charge on the orders of a Superintendent of Police, James Scott.
                            Bhagat Singh and his revolutionary friends decided to avenge the death of the dear leader.
                            However, in a case of mistaken identity, they assassinated another police official J P Saunders.
                            This was part of the Lahore Conspiracy Case.
                            After this incident, Singh fled from Lahore and made changes to his appearance.
